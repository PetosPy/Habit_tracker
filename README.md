# Habit_tracker
## Track your good Habits
This was a fun and enjoyable project for me personally.
It is a habit tracker that keeps score of how long you do an activity or how much time you
spend doing a certain thing in a day.
It could be reading a book, running, cycling etc... You name it!
I had to use:
Post()
Put()
and Delete()
requests in one project.

## Ingredients:
1. Requests module
2. datetime module
